# Minimax Algorithm Demo
Minimax algorithm demonstration in a tic-tac-toe game

This is a javascript project demonstrating the use of a minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI in the game tic-tac-toe, as a part of the freecodecamp training series.

## How it works
Minimax is a type of backtracking algorithm to find an optimal move against its opponent. The algorithm assumes that both players are playing optimally (trying their beswt to win)

The algorithm uses recursion to call itself over and over again to calculate values for each possible scanarios based on the current situation. It returns a score which is evaluated to determine the best path.
